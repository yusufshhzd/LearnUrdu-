There are a lack of one-stop resources to learning Urdu strictly through the Roman alphabet, and many resources to learning are often convoluted.
This application intends to serve as a simple place for a guide to learn Urdu, and for those who are not concerned about the Nastaliq script.
This resource is also mainly intended to help myself learn to speak Urdu, as someone who already can understand the language.
